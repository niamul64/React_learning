### 'hello-world' --> app--> if any one taking this app from github then need to run--> $ npm install --> (to install dependecies)
## 2. To create a react app we need to make a directory 
## 1. lets call the directory: My1stReactAapp: open terminal from that directory, Now create React app 'hello-world'
```
$ create-react-app hello-world
// will start creating app with -> react, react DOM, bebel
// Now, in terminal, we will see many suggestions command--> among them:
$ npm start 
// to start the app
```
## 2. Now change directory to app folder 'hello-world' and start app.
```
$ cd hello-world
$ npm start 
```

# src and public folders : 'src' folder --> is very important
## inside src folder--> we have 'index.js' to do code.
<hr>

### 1. inside the public folder we have 'index.html' we will use this to show on browser(only one HTML) 
```
<!-- inside the html file we only have 1 <div id='root'> -->

<div id="root"></div>

<!-- we will use only use this div to inject our react.js code -->
```
### 2. inside src folder--> we have 'index.js' to do react.js code.(only do code here)
<br>
<hr><br>
 
# Start coding inside the src folder: 
### 1. App.js->
```

```
