### Starting React app create at Local machine: Need to install: 1 node package on--> pc globally
```
$ npm install create-react-app -g
// to check the package is installed or not:
$ npm root -g
// we will see a directory and if we go to that directory then we will see 'create react app' folder. Means installed,
// We will use this to create react project
```
## Now, to create app we need to make a directory 
1. lets call the directory: My1stReactAapp: open terminal from that directory, Now create React app 'hello-world'
```
$ create-react-app hello-world
// will start creating app with -> react, react DOM, bebel
// Now, in terminal, we will see many suggestions command--> among them:
$ npm start 
// to start the app
```
2. Now change directory to app folder 'hello-world' and start app.
```
$ cd hello-world
$ npm start 
```
3. Now, a server will be created to run React--> see the browser
